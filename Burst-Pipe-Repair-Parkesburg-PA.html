<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine passes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent to drain. This procedure continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
