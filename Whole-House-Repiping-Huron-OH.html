<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. Most water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank replenished.</p>
