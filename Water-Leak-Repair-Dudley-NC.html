Backsiphonage is backflow brought on by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply.

<p>Gas and lp that comes out of the ground is totally odor free. The egg odor connected with gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security preventative measures you need to take to secure yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
