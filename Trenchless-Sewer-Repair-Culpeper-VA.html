<p>Unless your bathroom remodelling is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might effectively belong to your job requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which attracts the positively charged minerals in the water (a process called, ion exchange). The mineral deposits cling to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout your house. Tankless innovation makes sense.
