If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we show, inspect the directions.
