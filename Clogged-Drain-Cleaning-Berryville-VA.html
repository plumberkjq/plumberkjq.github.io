Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry.

While those savings are still substantial, new commercial softening technology utilizing multi-tank systems (MTS) also provides considerable water and salt savings.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more.
