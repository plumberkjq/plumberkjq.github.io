<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
