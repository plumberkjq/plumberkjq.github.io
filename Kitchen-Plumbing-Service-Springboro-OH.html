A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
