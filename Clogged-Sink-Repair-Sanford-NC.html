This procedure transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not stay with any surface in your house, keeping your devices and warm water heaters free of hard water scale develop. Salt-free softeners are likewise known as water conditioners because they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And since these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of recorded ions.</p>
