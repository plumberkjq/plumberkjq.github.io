Older toilets may work just great, however if your toilet is truly old (and outdated in style), you may wish to consider a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high threat" facilities.</p>
