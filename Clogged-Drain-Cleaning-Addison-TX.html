<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct result on your security, benefit, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- ensure your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the new unit in. While it's not likely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed against it will lead to decapitation, it may frighten a couple of years off your life.

That toilet must be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
