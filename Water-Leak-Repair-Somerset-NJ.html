<p>Make sure to check with your local authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) on the specific backflow prevention requirements for your area, system, and tenancy type. Your hot water heater is dead when the tank leaks. The dead giveaway that your water heater requires replacing is a sluggish drip below, typically showing up as a trail of rusty water. This suggests that the steel tank has rusted through and can't be fixed. Other signs, such as inadequate or no warm water, usually signal other hot water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>

<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to develop your plumbing abilities if you're reasonably unskilled. So conserve yourself some major problem by being honest with yourself about where your experience level is.

Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not required in most cases. Some elements such as relief valve bodies may need to be removed from the main body to assist in a repair. Knowing the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be essential.</p>
