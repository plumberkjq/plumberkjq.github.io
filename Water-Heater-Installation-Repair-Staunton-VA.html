<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractors in Staunton</h2>

<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, among which is likewise serves as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Examiner for the group. The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. Most water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
