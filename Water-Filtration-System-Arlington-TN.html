After completing your high school diploma or General Educational Advancement (GED) in many cases, you may want to consider attending a plumbing apprenticeship program.

<p>Faulty parts: If you have an electric water heater, a malfunctioning thermostat or a tripped breaker can trigger problems. If you have a gas system, the pilot burner may go out, resulting in little or no hot water. In basic, standard water heaters are expected to last 7-10 years with correct maintenance. If you're moving into a brand-new house, inspect the age of the existing water heater.
