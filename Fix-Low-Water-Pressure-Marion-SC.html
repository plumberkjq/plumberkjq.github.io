As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous intended uses around your home.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall.

Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a various design from the one we show, examine the directions. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
