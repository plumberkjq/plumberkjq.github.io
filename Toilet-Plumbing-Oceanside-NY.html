The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked yearly. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before operating the irrigation system.
