<p>Removing or reducing water solidity is done with a piece of equipment known as a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process happens. A softener is comprised of various parts, each having their own special purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel generally built out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with adversely charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is frequently described. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electrical timer that recharges the system and flushes on a regular schedule.</p>
