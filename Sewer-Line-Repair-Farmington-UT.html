<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system as the outcome of the downstream pressure being higher than the supply pressure. This reduction in supply pressure takes place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water mains). Waste disposal unit warranties last an average of 5 years, however they can range between 2 and 10 years. Given that the average life-span of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might want to purchase a prolonged warranty. Most warranties cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To prevent further breakdowns, property owners need to keep up with routine maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the concern if this is the case. You might have to check out utilizing a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
