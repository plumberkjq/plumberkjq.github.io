<p>Tough water stops washing cleaning agents and cosmetic cleansers from working as effectively. When washing products are used in hard water - tough water ions bond with surfactants making them unavailable to bond with water. It's a great idea to have a professional assess your drain system if you experience clogs and backups in your home more than a few times. A drain professional like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system. Frequently, if you have numerous drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can locate and identify the problem so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that must also be well preserved to assist prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and break or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
