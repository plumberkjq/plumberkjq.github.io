<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to service? The timing of regrowth depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water really needs it. Newer units use digital sensors that keep an eye on bead deficiency and other key metrics based on your water use and therefore just regenerate when needed.
