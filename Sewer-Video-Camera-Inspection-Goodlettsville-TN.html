<p>The double check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire defense market, producing a redundancy developed to guarantee that a person check valve will continue to secure the city supply of water even if the other stops working. This assembly also enables the closure of one valve to decrease the pressure differential throughout the other, producing a more reliable seal and avoiding even small backflow leakage.

<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
