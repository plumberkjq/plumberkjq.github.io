<p>Irrigation backflow devices are created for installation on drinkable water lines to secure against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of contaminated water into the safe and clean supply of water. While there's not an exact schedule regarding when you must repipe your house, you should certainly look into repiping if they haven't been performed in 50 years or more-- particularly if you reside in an older house built closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our a/c system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe what exactly was wrong with the system, how he fixed the issue, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would highly advise Hunter for any issues you might have.</p>
