Call (866) 701-5306 to schedule a consultation. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not commonly defined by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
<p>Cooking oil and other greases must never be put down the garbage disposal due to the fact that they can hamper the blades. Lastly, cold water should be running when the garbage disposal is on and need to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to ensure that all food particles have been rinsed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles avoid flatware from entering the waste disposal unit, so you're only sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
