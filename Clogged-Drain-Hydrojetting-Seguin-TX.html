When the pressure drops for some factor such as may take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation happens, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an incident, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention method utilized. The best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air gap is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is needed.

<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
