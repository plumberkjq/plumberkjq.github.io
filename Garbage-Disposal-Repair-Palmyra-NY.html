<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty.
