<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
