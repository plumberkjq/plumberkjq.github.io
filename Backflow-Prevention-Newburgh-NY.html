This implies that the steel tank has rusted through and can't be repaired. Other symptoms, such as inadequate or no warm water, typically signal other water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). If your valve is a different style from the one we reveal, check the instructions. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
