The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems.

<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads end up being filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated, hard water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these signs.</p>

It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
