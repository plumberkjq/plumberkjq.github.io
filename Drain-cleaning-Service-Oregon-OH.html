<p>A. We highly advise a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers obstruct any water from negative or back pressure in your watering system at shutdown from going into back into your water source, therefore reducing the risk of contamination of your water source. Many towns need using an approved backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You may wish to talk to your local town prior to installing your irrigation system.</p>
