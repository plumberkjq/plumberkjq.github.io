<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your security, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. Your water is red or brown. Some kinds of pipes can rust with time. This rust will break off into your house's water supply and can turn your tap water a reddish or brown  color.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
