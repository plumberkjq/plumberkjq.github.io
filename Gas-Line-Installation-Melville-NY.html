If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you must take to protect yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
