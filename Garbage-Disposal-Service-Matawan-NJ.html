As soon as you have actually gotten to this point, you can decide about the plumber and move forward with hiring him or her to do a project. Think about beginning with a job that's less involved than, say, repiping the whole house. Start with a faucet replacement or the repair of a leaky toilet. See how the plumber does on this smaller sized task.</p>
<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Examine the instructions if your valve is a various style from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
