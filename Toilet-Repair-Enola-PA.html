<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never exactly matches supply.
