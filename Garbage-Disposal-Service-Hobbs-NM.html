<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to figure out if and in some cases where a leak has actually happened in systems which consist of liquids and gases. Many pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers discover their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices normally receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, as well as some technical direction, each year. Technical guideline includes safety, local plumbing codes and regulations, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and organisations. The majority of apprentices enter a program straight, but some begin as assistants or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
