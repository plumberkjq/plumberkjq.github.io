<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
