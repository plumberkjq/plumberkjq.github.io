<p>Unless your bathroom restoration is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may extremely well be part of your job requirements. Water goes into the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has an unfavorable charge, which draws in the favorably charged minerals in the water (a process referred to as, ion exchange). The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and flows throughout your home. Tankless technology makes good sense.
