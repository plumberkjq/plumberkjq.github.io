<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>

Attempt releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
