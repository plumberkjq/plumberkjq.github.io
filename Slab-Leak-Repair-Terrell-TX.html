<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Toilet efficiency- The higher the effectiveness of the toilet, the more it costs. The performance of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. Find out if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). You may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older home (developed pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing, this is an alternative to consider. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
