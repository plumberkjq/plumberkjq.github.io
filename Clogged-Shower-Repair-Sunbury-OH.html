<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Sunbury OH</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
