If it was constructed prior to 1970, it may have pipes made from an outdated material that will start to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't already).

If you haven't done so currently, we recommend setting up carbon monoxide gas detectors beyond bed room doors to signal you of any prospective gas leaks.</p>
