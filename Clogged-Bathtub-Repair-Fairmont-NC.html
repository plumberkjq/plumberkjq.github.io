<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Fairmont NC</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>If you choose to try this task yourself, be prepared to keep careful track of about a dozen tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them drop the drain). There are many different faucet designs, so you might not be able to tell what to replace up until you've done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or work with a plumber, this would be a good time to think about whether you want to upgrade the faucet with a brand-new style.</p>
