<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to remove wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk includes the oldest known examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had quickly detachable and replaceable sections, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>The check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire protection industry, developing a redundancy designed to ensure that one check valve will continue to protect the city supply of water even if the other stops working. This assembly also makes it possible for the closure of one valve to decrease the pressure differential across the other, developing a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor backflow leak. Test dicks, or little ball valves, make it possible for the accessory of testing equipment that assesses whether the check assembly is functional.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
