Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage.
