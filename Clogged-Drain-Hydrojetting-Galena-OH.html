For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
<p>The typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older home (developed pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing, this is an alternative to think about. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous decades, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and does not have the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
