The effectiveness of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in numerous parts of the plumbing system, a lot of typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low circulation issues or perhaps stop a fixture from flowing altogether.
