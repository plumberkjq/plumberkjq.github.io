<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about completely restored.</p>
