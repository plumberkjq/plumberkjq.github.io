This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is required to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simplicity of its design and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be unwise in numerous circumstances to install a pipe sector of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
