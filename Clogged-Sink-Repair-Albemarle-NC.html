<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Again, it is a good idea to inspect the producer's directions for special preventative measures.</p>
<p>Regrettably, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it typically ends up being corrosive.
