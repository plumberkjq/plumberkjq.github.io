In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any remaining contaminants.</p>

The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the lifetime of some appliances. Water softening is usually attained using ion-exchange resins.
