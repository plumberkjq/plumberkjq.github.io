<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will cause your water to look rusty or brown, and the water might have a bad or foul odor to it. When the piping in your house begins to reveal any of these indications of corrosion, you will inevitably need to repipe the entire plumbing system. The reason a toilet won't flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain below the toilet can also be the cause. Employing a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your first step; a plumber can diagnose the concern and repair it.</p>
