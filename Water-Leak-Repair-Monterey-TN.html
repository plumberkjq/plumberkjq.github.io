<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is just recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
