<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
