Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
