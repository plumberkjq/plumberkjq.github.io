<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
