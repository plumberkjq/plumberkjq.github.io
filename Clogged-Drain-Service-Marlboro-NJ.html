Matt Mertz Plumbing, Inc., can help you there, too. We install efficient systems that get you the water supply you need.

If you have kids, remind them to prevent holding on any visible pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Hanging on a pipeline might cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly accessible in an emergency.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
