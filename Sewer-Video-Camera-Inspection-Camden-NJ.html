Well, first let's ask you a different question: How old is your house? If it was developed before 1970, it might have pipes made from an out-of-date material that will begin to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not currently).

Repiping now will offer you assurance and prevent larger leakages down the road.</p>
