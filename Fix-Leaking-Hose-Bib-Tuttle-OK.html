Nevertheless, it includes a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a relatively small cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
