Call your insurance agent and confirm your protection. Double check with your agent to validate that your understanding is proper when you have checked out through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered.</p>

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
