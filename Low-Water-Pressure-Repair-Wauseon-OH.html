<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Because I love to cook, I create a whole lot of dishes. We established a short-lived workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, but after a day of this we understood that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the home within thirty minutes and he ensures that the sink will remain clog-free for 1 month. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are very delighted that we chose Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will certainly use this company again and again in the future.</p>
