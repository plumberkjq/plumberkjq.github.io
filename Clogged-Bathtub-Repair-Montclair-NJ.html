<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components unusable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain effectively or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist.
