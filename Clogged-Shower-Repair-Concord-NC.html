Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not include any excavation.

The pipe lining procedure involves our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is completely filled, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and fractures. If heat is used, the liner is left to harden in place for numerous hours or 60 minutes. When the process is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to make sure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
