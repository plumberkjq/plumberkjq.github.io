<p>Those people in the industry know that cross-connection programs in many locations have actually significantly lowered the variety of reported events that happen within our water supply. This has at times resulted in individuals believing that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there may never really have been a problem in the first place. This thinking can be both harmful and disadvantageous. Backflow occurrences in water systems are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a reduced pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow protection. We need to look at each installation for the hazard it provides and after that install the proper security.</p>

The large amount of energy, cash, and time required to clean up the damaging adverse effects of difficult water is dizzying. An entire home water softener is the service to the scourge of water firmness.</p>
