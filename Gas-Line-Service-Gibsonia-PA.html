A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without restraining water circulation.

<p>Your sewer line issue can lead to sewer backups, and they usually happen in the most affordable open drain. This kind of issue is normally the outcome of an obstruction in the line.
