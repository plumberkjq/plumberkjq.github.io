<p>Leaks can happen if the seal in between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain stops working. Since the tank or the entire toilet need to be raised off the floor for a correct repair, either of these leakages can be tough to fix by yourself. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a far more expensive repair. Ryan's Plumbing has carefully trained workers who will treat your toilet and house with the utmost care.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be checked yearly. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked annually to guarantee the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
