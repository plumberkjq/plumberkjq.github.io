<p>A couple of local authorities need that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the luxury of the irrigated area. It might not be set up in any location where it may ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not enable the use of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some don't permit the use of a PVB at all, so consult your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer might spill or spit water out of under the cap when backflow happens, so it must be installed in a location where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
<p>When you get rid of the cap to eliminate the valve, check the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is cheap and simple. However finding the best washer may not be. The most common washers are frequently available at home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be hard to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
