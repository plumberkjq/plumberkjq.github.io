<p>If you find a leak and opt for a patching job instead of a repiping job, simply remember that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the exact same product and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to think about repiping your entire home when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
