<p>When the parameters for a PVB can not be met, a Reduced Pressure-Principle (RP) - ASSE 1013 will be installed. Needed to be outdoors, no restriction on elevation of sprinkler heads, and mounted 18"- 60" above grade at the installed area. If you take a look at your home's plumbing pipes and see spots, staining, flaking, little imprints or rust, your pipes are rusting. Corroding pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they haven't currently) and must be replaced as quickly as possible.</p>

Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
