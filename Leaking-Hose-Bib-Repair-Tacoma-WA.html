<p>Natural Gas and lp that comes out of the ground is entirely odor free. The egg smell associated with natural gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you must take to safeguard yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
