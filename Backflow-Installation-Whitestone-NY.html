<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 indications of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate gradually, they gradually start to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much buildup to take place, so by the time you see it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>
